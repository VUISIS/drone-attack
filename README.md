# Drone Attacks
This repository contains different attack scenarios based on MAVSDK C++ and MAVSDK Java. The goal is that by prototyping on MAVSDK, we have control over the low-level messages (MAVSDK C++ only), work on encryption, and eventually we can transfer these attack scenarios and security mechanisms to PFlight.
